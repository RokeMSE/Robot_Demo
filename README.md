### How to run the Demo test:
- In order to run the test, a Gemini API need to be provided (placed in an .env file).
- After that, the command `robot .\{file_name}.robot` can be used to run the demo Testcases.

- Libraries Requirements:
    + `pip install robotframework`
    + `pip install robotframework-flaui`

- For added test, refer to the [FlaUI Library Keywords Documentation](https://gdatasoftwareag.github.io/robotframework-flaui/keywords/4.0.0.html#library-documentation-top) and adjust the Gemini prompt accordingly.

- ***NOTICE***: Because the XPath(s) are generated by AI, it's not cosistent for every run and can either fail or pass, try again when needed.
